# General Resources

## Personal Epowerment Protocol 
### PEP
Personal empowerment protocol:
1. Read the error
1. Formulate a question
1. Google your problem
1. Ask a question in slack channel
1. Send slack to all instructors

### Asking good questions
Here are Stack Overflow guidelines on asking a good question, which became the industry standard
https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask

### Example of questions
@channel general announcement:
When you guys slack DM us, please just write the whole message/problem at one take instead of
“Hey #{name}!”
(Waiting for the response from me, usually “Hey!“)
“Can I ask you a question?”
(Waiting for the response from me, usually “sure!“)
“#{problem}”
It’s just easier to manage messages if you just say what’s on your heart  so, in the perfect world you’d say:
“Hey, #{staff.name}! Here’s a problem I have: #{student.problem}. It’s this lab: #{lab.title}, #{lab.url}. So far, I’ve tried these solutions: #{idea_one}, #{idea_two}. Here is the screenshot/github link/screen recording. My goal is #{student.goal}. Could you please help? Thank you!”

### Reminder
Hey everyone! Quick note -- We love helping you all, and seeing all the amazing projects you're building, but by following the protocol, it becomes easier for us to help multiple groups at once when we know:
what the error is
what you tried (so we don't ask you to try something you've already tried)
what is the expected behavior
not saying to post in the channel for the project, message us directly! but please try to outline the full scope of the project when messaging us for help :pray:

## Before pair programming
- CASK feedback framework write-up: https://medium.com/unsupervised-learning/giving-actionable-specific-and-kind-feedback-6fc83eb04a65
- Recipe for a good pair-programming experience: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5UJk5FJ2MGNtkAR48-RdpQiUzoHARNbdfluWR8miIk/edit?usp=sharing

Contract for pair programming: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ce3zFnY_z3VoVQNmpqQHt1Bm00l8HThioPubD80Haq4/edit?usp=sharing
Make a copy of this doc before filling out. One per team.


## After pair programming
 If your pair is done with lab. Here is the feedback form: LINK. Please take few mins to feel it out before you provide feedback to your partner.

## Getting Comfortable with Command Line
Hey folks! Here's a video by one of our coaches that will help you get more comfortable with the command line. Check it out once you've finished those labs 
https://youtu.be/WH_Zp_aMKXU
Here's a mini challenge, after watching the video, try to create and organize your files for the program!
It should look something like this:
```
Flatiron/
   |
   |-- Mod1/
        |- Labs/
        |- DQs/
        |- Code-Challenge/
        |- Project/
   |-- Mod2/
        |- Labs/
     ...etc
```

## Notes
I noticed some of you take notes in google docs or Apple’s notes, which maybe is a suboptimal experience when it comes to writing code. I personally use Boostnote (free), which allows you to take notes and embed code. Here are some other options: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-note-taking-tools-programmers/

- **Fonts and accessibility:**
> Currently, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not specify the requirements for choosing an accessible website typeface. However, the US Department of Health & Human Services unofficially recommends the following fonts for PDF files: Times New Roman, Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, and Calibri. (...) Designers who are looking to maximize the legibility of their websites should investigate fonts that have been created with readers with dyslexia or visual impairments in mind, such as **Read Regular** (http://www.readregular.com/english/regular.html), **Lexie Readable** (http://www.k-type.com/fonts/lexie-readable/), and **Tiresias** (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/tiresias-infofont).
When all else fails, the best option for an accessible website is a popular font with a clean, sans serif aesthetic. Some of the most appropriate fonts in this regard are **Arial, Helvetica, Lucida Sans, Tahoma, and Verdana.**
