# Mod 5

## Week 1 Day 1

### morning
@channel To recap everything we have said today, and to make the process clear:
 - spend the next days researching everything you will need for your project (e.g. redux, apis if you’re using, named scope, guard clauses, etc.); DO NOT CODE YOUR PROJECT YET! Let me be clear:  YOU CANNOT CODE YOUR PROJECT BEFORE MVP PITCH (Wednesday);
 - when you come in on Tuesday, please have an idea ready (or two ideas, if you struggle with choosing); you will have only 3 minutes to pitch it to us; for that, we will need you to tell us only what the app does (user stories);
 - then, on Wednesday, you will have the MVP pitch (see below the requirements); after you have received our approval, you will be able to start coding your project;
 - then, on the next Tuesday you will have MVP presentation (10 minutes); you will have to come prepared with your functional app, component hierarchy, domain model, and stretch goals; treat this with utmost seriousness;
**VERY IMPORTANT: fill out this document:** LINK TO THE TRACKER
On Wednesday we expect you to come with:
 - domain model (in e.g. mockapp, awwboard)
 - wireframes (in e.g. Adobe XD, mockapp, awwboard)
 - user stories
 - timeline with deliverables (“goal of the day” for each day in the tracker file above)
 - mvp description and stretch goals so it is clear what exactly your mvp is (in the tracker file above)
 - technologies used (in the tracker file above)
 - stretch goals (in the tracker file above)
**ABOUT MVP:**
 - dream big, plan small — have 50,000 stretch goals but only 5 mvp features;
 - when thinking about project presentations, think about worst-case scenario (something went awfully wrong) - what would be minimal but presentable state of your app? Then, still cut 30% of features off;
 - your MVP cannot have any fancy technology (do not even come to the pitch with an idea of using web sockets, hooks, d3, or anything of that kind — that will mean you did not read, or read and disregarded, this message);
 - if in doubt, reach out to @Mohammed Shaikh who has just stripped his app down by 70% and arrived at an mvp idea;
**ABOUT IDEAS:**
Here’s a blog post with ideas:
https://dev.to/sylwiavargas/33-app-ideas-for-bootcamp-students-code-newbies-3n28
If you’re completely lost, I am happy to brainstorm 
**ABOUT MOD5:**
 - every day we will have a standup; before standup you have to have goal for the day revised in the tracker;
 - every day before you leave you need to fill out end of the day reflection;
 - you are accountable of your project’s success; do not bite more than you can chew at once; if you choose any technology that’s not in our curriculum, it might be that you will have to deal with it on your own (with the help of twitterverse, slack channels and stack overflow)
 - it is possible to fail mod5

## Week 1 Day 2

### morning
@here Good morning!
Today you will pitch your app idea. You will have 3 minutes to tell us about user stories and/or ask question(s).
Tomorrow you will have 10 minutes to deliver domain model, wireframes, timeline, stretch goals and tech used.
 Please book an appointments here — one for today’s idea pitch and one for tomorrow’s MVP pitch 
LINK TO YOUR CAL APPT
 It may happen that you will be called earlier or later so be on Slack where we will live update the list. 

### etiquette reminder
@here hey folks! Basic etiquette for MOD5:
 - if you see that someone is coding and focused — DO NOT disturb them unless you have discussed that with them prior and they do not mind being disturbed; otherwise, you can slack them to ask if you could take their time
 - MOD5 area is a quiet zone: if you wanna talk (even about your project, or debugging) — go to the kitchen or the nook!
 - look out for others to make sure that they do take breaks, stay hydrated and nourished
 - remind others to be quiet and courteous
 - if you have a question to me, Rei or Eric, also slack us (for instance: “Hey {staff.name}! I am struggling with {user.problem.description}. I was wondering if I could take {number} minutes to ask you a few questions”)
It is going to be tense and straining so let’s make sure to eliminate all imperfect situations 

### EOD
@here Reminder!
For tomorrow, you will need the following in this file: LINK
- project idea sheet filled out (project idea, mvp, stretch goals, tech used)
- “goal of the day” for EVERY DAY until the end of the mod
- When it comes to stretch goals, put numbers on them (e.g.: (1) Auth - lorem ipsum; (2) pure CSS) 
Separately:
- Wireframes
- Domain model

## Week 1 Day 3

### morning
@here  Two few reminders:
Commit your code every hour or every feature you’ve built. This is to show your employers that you have been working hard these three weeks. Also, to retrieve your code in case you made a major error or something horrible happened to your computer;
Ask us questions ONLY after you have googled, and asked your colleagues, all-about-code or stack overflow; before coming here, send us a message describing what the problem is, and what you’ve googled so far;
