SQL Pokemon Lab:
Hey folks! In order to get the lab rolling, you’d need to start with schema_migration.sql  file. You can figure out what the sql statement should contain by reading the specs.
However, since the readme kinda states that this file should already be given to you, I add the code snippet in the comment.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pokemon(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, type TEXT);
```
